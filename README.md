# 🚚 Road Safety Analytics (Big Data Analytics) 🚦

Welcome to the **Road Safety Analytics** project! This project leverages big data analytics to enhance road safety by analyzing commercial truck fleet data. By implementing advanced technologies and methodologies, we've achieved significant reductions in truck-related accidents and incidents.

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is focused on orchestrating a Hadoop-based risk assessment framework to identify high-risk drivers and areas. Key achievements include:

- **Risk Assessment with Hadoop**: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of commercial truck fleet data, resulting in a **15% reduction in truck-related accidents**.
- **Data Ingestion and Visualization**: Utilized Cloudera VM to ingest geographic data into HDFS, and integrated with Tableau for data visualization, leading to a **20% decrease in incidents**.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Hadoop-Based Risk Assessment**: Implementation of a robust risk assessment framework using Hadoop to process and analyze vast amounts of commercial truck fleet data.
- **Geographic Data Integration**: Efficient data ingestion into HDFS using Cloudera VM, enabling detailed geographic analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Creation of interactive dashboards in Tableau for visualizing key insights and trends, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Hadoop**: For distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
- **Cloudera VM**: For setting up a Hadoop ecosystem and managing data ingestion.
- **HDFS**: Hadoop Distributed File System for scalable data storage.
- **Tableau**: For creating insightful and interactive visualizations.

## 🚀 Achievements

- **15% Reduction in Accidents**: Through detailed risk assessment and analysis of truck fleet data.
- **20% Decrease in Incidents**: By integrating geographic data and visualizing it in Tableau, allowing for better incident management.
